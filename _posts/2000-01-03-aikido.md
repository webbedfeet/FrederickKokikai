# Aikido

Aikido is a primarily defensive martial art derived from aiki-jujitsu and founded by Sensei Morihei Ueshiba, or _O-Sensei_. The art 
developed in the 1940s in Japan. The central premise of aikido is to re-direct the energy of an attacker using circular movements to 
diffuse an attack and control the attacker, often resulting in either the attacker being thrown to the ground or pinned using a 
variety of joint locks.

Aikido was brought to Hawaii in the 1950s and then to the continental United States. It grew in the United States through the leadership of 
many high-ranking instructors who moved from Japan to the United States. Over the years many instructors branched out to form their own
organizations and aikido styles, while maintaining connections with Japan. 

Aikido in the United States benefited greatly from the rise of Steven Seagal in Hollywood. Seagal, a high-ranking aikido practitioner in 
his own right, brought the art to the silver screen in a series of movies. 

Today, aikido is widely practiced in the United States and around the world, in YMCAs, clubs and formal _dojos_.
