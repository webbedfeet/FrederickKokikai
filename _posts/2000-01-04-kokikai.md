# Kokikai Aikido

[Kokikai Aikido](http://www.kokikai.org) was founded by Shuji Maruyama Sensei. Our practice is based on 4 basic principles:

> 1. Keep One Point to Develop Calmness
> 2. Relax Progressively
> 3. Find Correct Posture in Everything	
> 4. Develop your Positive Mind

These principles guide our practice and provide a touchstone against which we can evaluate our practice. 

Kokikai practice includes empty hand practice, defending against knife (_tanto_), sword (_bokken_) and staff (_jo_), and 
forms (_kata_) for sword and staff. Other aspects of Kokikai practice include Ki Meditation and Kiatsu (acupressure)

## Shuji Maruyama Sensei

Maruyama Sensei was a student of Ueshiba Sensei as a young man. He came to the United States in 1968 and established a presence in 
Phildelphia soon after. After teaching aikido in the United States for many years and founding Kokikai Aikido, he returned to Japan, but 
returns regularly to teach at national camps, advanced seminars and at several dojos around the United States.
